        The first project I ever worked on was making a list for zookeepers to keep track of the animals names.
        The goal of the project was to help us understand how lists work and how to input images.
        I enjoyed this project because it helped me understand how to make a proper list that explains itself.
        The link is above this paragraph.

            I actually liked this project a lot, because I use something similair in my everyday life.
            This was the introductory to CSS.
            It is just an organization of grocery items and where they would be placed in a kitchen.

        <p>
            This was a javascript project.
            We were given a code to a vault and we are supposed to use arithmetic operators to make equations to equal each number of the code of the vault.
            Javascript is no joke.
            I believe it is one of the harder types of code to write.
