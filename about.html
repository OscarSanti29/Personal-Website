        <p> 
            I have been going to the gym for about 6 months now and I guess I can call this a hobbie.
            I try to go as often as I can when I have free time.
            Ive come to really enjoy it, great way to decompress, destress and stay healthy.
        </p>

        <p class="record"> 
            I have about 50+ vinyl records. 
            Im a big fan of oldies, but I also have vinyl records of newer artists.
            It's just something about playing vinyl records that makes you feel like you lived in those eras.
            Whenever I have the time I go to stores that sell vinyls and just browse around and maybe listen to a couple if its available.

     <h3> Gardening</h3>
    <div class="container">

        <p>
            Plants have really grown on me. 
            It feels nice being able to grow like rosemary or mint and use that in recipes.
            Literally using fresh ingridients.
            So far that is all im growing just mint and rosemary but I plan to expand my garden.
